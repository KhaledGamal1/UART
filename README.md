# UART Design with FIFO and Baud Rate Generator

This project implements a **Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)** in Verilog, with integrated **Baud Rate Generator**, **Transmitter and Receiver FSMs**, and **FIFO buffers** for reliable data handling.  

The design is parameterized, supports oversampling (16Ã—), and is suitable for FPGA-based communication systems.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Baud Rate Generator**
  - Generates tick signals based on system clock and target baud rate.
  - Uses oversampling (16 ticks per bit) for accurate data reception.
- **UART Receiver**
  - FSM with Idle, Start, Data, and Stop states.
  - Samples incoming bits at mid-points using oversampling.
  - Asserts `rx_done_tick` when a full byte is received.
- **UART Transmitter**
  - FSM with Idle, Start, Data, and Stop states.
  - Shifts out data bits at the correct baud rate.
  - Asserts `tx_done_tick` when transmission is complete.
- **FIFO Buffers**
  - Separate TX and RX FIFOs to handle data rate mismatches.
  - FWFT (First Word Fall Through) design for immediate data availability.
  - Provides `empty` and `full` flags.
- **Parameterizable**
  - System clock frequency (`f`)
  - Baud rate (`b`)
  - Data bit width (`DBIT`)
  - Stop bit ticks (`SB_TICK`)
